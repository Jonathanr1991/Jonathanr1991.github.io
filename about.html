                  My name is Jonathan Rodriquez and im a senior at Towson Univeristy. I am expected to graduate in the spring of 2020. I am slightly unconventional 
                  college student in the aspect that I started college in my mid 20's. Before my return to school I worked at Georgetown prep for about 10 years 
                  starting at the end of the freshman year of high school and continuing until after graduation. I started as a cashier for the consetion stand and 
                  eventally worked by way up to being office manager for the Dining Services department. While my job there was rewarding as the dining services 
                  expanded far greater than just providing meals for students we also had an extensive catering division, it was not first choice in terms of a 
                  career path. Technology was my true area of imterest. Once getting my feet wet in my first couple a years college I decieded that I had to make a 
                  move to the technology sector. I was given the oportunity at Maxim Healthcare for my first job in the Technology sector as a summer intern. There 
                  I worked as esintually
